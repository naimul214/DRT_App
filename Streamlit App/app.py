**The Dublin Bus App has been built in an attempt to use real time data using the API's provided by the [National Transport Authority](https://developer.nationaltransport.ie/). Using this app you can see the incoming buses for a selected stop and the buses that currently operate a route based on a direction.**

## üéØ **Road Map**

Plan to develop the app:

- **Understand the data provided by the APIs**
- **Explore the static data provided by the NTA to complement data shown in the APIs**
- **Design the logic for `StopTimes` and `BusLocator` pages**

## üèóÔ∏è **Deployment**

 1. **Understand the data provided by the APIs**:
   - First, sign up for the [National Transport Authority (NTA)](https://developer.nationaltransport.ie/) to access their APIs. Use the following link to sign up: [Sign up here](https://developer.nationaltransport.ie/signup).
   - Next, understand and visualise the data provided by the following endpoints:
      - [GTFSR Endpoint](https://api.nationaltransport.ie/gtfsr/v2/gtfsr?format=json)
      - [Vehicles Endpoint](https://api.nationaltransport.ie/gtfsr/v2/Vehicles?format=json)
   - To assist with exploring these endpoints, I have created a Jupyter Notebook (JN): [00_EndpointExploration.ipynb](https://github.com/josericodata/DublinBusApp/blob/main/assets/dataCleaning/00_EndpointExploration.ipynb). Replace `os.environ.get("API_KEY")` with the variable `YOUR_API_KEY`, and you're ready to proceed.   

 2. **Exploring and Preparing NTA Dublin Bus Static Data**:
   - Please head over to the following link: [GTFS Dublin Bus Data](https://www.transportforireland.ie/transitData/Data/GTFS_Dublin_Bus.zip). This will download the file `GTFS_Dublin_Bus.zip`. After downloading, extract the files.
   - We will need the following files from the extracted data:
      1. `routes.txt`
      2. `stops.txt`
      3. `stop_times.txt`
      4. `trips.txt`
   - These files will be used to generate the following files required for our app:
      1. `Routes.txt`
      2. `StopMapLocation.txt`
      3. `StopTimesPerTrip.txt`
      4. `Towards.txt`
   - To visualise this step, I have created a JN: [01_DataCleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/josericodata/DublinBusApp/blob/main/assets/dataCleaning/01_DataCleaning.ipynb).
   - **The files mentioned above were used in the early stages of this project. However, since the NTA updates `GTFS_Dublin_Bus.zip` almost every week, maintaining the app required frequent updates.
     To simplify this process, I created [DataPrep.py](https://github.com/josericodata/DublinBusApp/blob/main/streamlit_app/modules/DataPrep.py). With this script, every time the app runs,
     it fetches fresh data from [GTFS Dublin Bus Data](https://www.transportforireland.ie/transitData/Data/GTFS_Dublin_Bus.zip). I am keeping the old `.txt` files in case they help someone better understand this complex process.**

3. **What is GTFS?**

- Summarising point 1 and 2, the **General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)** is a standardised format for public transportation data, allowing transit agencies to share schedules, routes, and real-time updates. It consists of structured text files that define agencies, stops, routes, trips, and schedules.

üîπ **GTFS Data Types:**

| Type            | Description |
|----------------|------------|
| **GTFS Realtime** | Delivers live updates on vehicle positions, delays, and service alerts. Uses `GTFSR` and `Vehicles` endpoints. |
| **GTFS Static**   | Provides fixed schedules, routes, and stop locations. Uses `GTFS_Dublin_Bus.zip`. |

- For more details, visit the official GTFS website: [GTFS.org](https://gtfs.org/)

4. **Logic Design for `StopTimes` and `BusLocator` Pages**:   
   - After understanding the data provided by the endpoints and the static files, it is time to develop the logic for the pages.
   - **`StopTimes` Page**:  
      - The user will first select a `route`, then be prompted to choose a `direction`, and finally select a `stop` to display the buses that are due to arrive.  
      - For a clear understanding of this flow, refer to the JN: [02_Flow_01_‚åö_StopTimes.ipynb](https://github.com/josericodata/DublinBusApp/blob/main/assets/dataCleaning/02_Flow_01_‚åö_StopTimes.ipynb).
   - **`BusLocator` Page**:  
      - This page will show the operating buses for the selected `route` and `direction`.  
      - For more details on this logic, refer to the JN: [03_Flow_02_üìç_BusLocator.ipynb](https://github.com/josericodata/DublinBusApp/blob/main/assets/dataCleaning/03_Flow_02_üìç_BusLocator.ipynb).

5. **Streamlit App Creation**:  
   - After completing the steps above, the final app can be found at: [streamlit_app](https://github.com/josericodata/DublinBusApp/tree/main/streamlit_app).

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Local Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/DublinBusApp.git
```
**Hint:** Replace `user` with `josericodata` in the URL above. I am deliberately asking you to pause here so you can support my work. If you appreciate it, please consider giving the repository a star or forking it. Your support means a lot‚Äîthank you! üòä

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd DublinBusApp
```

3. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venvDublinBus
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv venvDublinBus/bin/activate
```

5. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Navigate to the modules directory:
```bash
cd streamlit_app/modules
```

7. Please locate in `BLutils.py` and `STutils.py` the following line code:
```bash
YOUR_API_KEY = st.secrets["API_KEY"]
```
It is crutial to replace `st.secrets["API_KEY"]` with the actual API Key provided by the [National Transport Authority](https://developer.nationaltransport.ie/) after [signing up](https://developer.nationaltransport.ie/signup) to acces their APIs. Please use the following link to sign up: https://developer.nationaltransport.ie/signup


8. Go back one directory and  run the app:
```bash
cd ..
```

Then run

```bash
streamlit run 00_üöå_Info.py
```

The app will be live at `http://localhost:8501`.


## üîÆ **Future Enhancements**

Planned improvements for the Dublin Bus App include:

- **Database Integration**: Implementing a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to better manage and query data, enabling faster performance and enhanced data relationships between routes, stops, and trips.
- **Historical Data Storage**: Storing historical bus data to provide insights like delay trends, busiest stops, and more accurate arrival time predictions using machine learning.
- **Personalised Features**: Adding user-specific data storage, such as favorite routes or frequently accessed stops, for a more tailored experience.
- **Advanced Reporting and Analytics**: Generating detailed reports, such as route popularity or stop traffic trends, with visualisations like heatmaps or charts.
- **Enhanced Pages**: Introducing new pages and features, including route performance tracking, user feedback collection, and real-time bus location improvements.
- **Scalability**: Preparing the app for multi-user support by efficiently handling concurrent queries through the database.


## üéì **Motivation**

- The motivation behind developing this app is to gain hands-on experience in working with JSON-formatted data from real-time APIs. As a resident of Ireland, I found Dublin Bus data particularly convenient, as I am familiar with many of the routes, buses, and stops.
- Additionally, this project helps me stay up to date with my skills while serving as a valuable addition to my portfolio, showcasing my abilities in handling and processing data effectively.

## üîß **Environment Setup**

This app has been built and tested in the following environment:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy)
- **Python Version**: Python 3.10.12
